# 🚀 Git Workflow Guide for Team Collaboration (2 Developers)

This document defines a clean, collaborative Git workflow for projects involving two (or more) developers. It ensures safe contribution, minimal conflicts, and a clean Git history.

---

## 🧱 1. Initial Project Setup (One-Time by Project Owner)

1. Create a GitHub repository.
2. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/org/project-name.git
   cd project-name
   ```
3. Add necessary starter files (README.md, .gitignore, etc.).
4. Invite collaborators in GitHub:
   - Settings → Manage Access → Invite Collaborators

---

## 👤 2. One-Time Local Setup for Each Developer

Every developer should run the following:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/org/project-name.git
cd project-name

# Pull the latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

---

## 🔄 3. Daily Developer Workflow

This is the repeatable workflow each developer should follow:

### ✅ Step 1: Pull Latest `main`

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feat/<feature-name>
```

> Examples: `feat/login`, `fix/header-bug`, `refactor/user-service`

---

### ✅ Step 3: Do Your Work

- Make your changes
- Frequently commit:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "feat: <clear, meaningful message>"
  ```

---

### ✅ Step 4: Push Your Feature Branch

```bash
git push origin feat/<feature-name>
```

---

## 🔁 4. Sync With Main Before Creating PR

Before merging your work or creating a Pull Request, always **sync your feature branch** with the latest `main`.

### Option 1: Using `merge` (easier for beginners)

```bash
git checkout feat/<feature-name>
git pull origin main
# Resolve any conflicts in VS Code
git add .
git commit -m "merge: resolved conflicts with main"
git push origin feat/<feature-name>
```

---

### Option 2: Using `rebase` (cleaner history)

```bash
git checkout feat/<feature-name>
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
# Resolve conflicts if any
git add .
git rebase --continue
git push origin feat/<feature-name> --force
```

> ✅ Use `--force` only on your **own feature branch**.

---

## 🔁 5. Create a Pull Request (PR)

1. Go to GitHub → Pull Requests → New Pull Request.
2. Choose:
   - **Base branch**: `main`
   - **Compare branch**: `feat/<your-feature>`
3. Add a title, description, and assign a reviewer.
4. Submit the PR.

---

## 🔄 6. Review & Merge

Once your PR is approved:
- Click **"Merge Pull Request"**
- Delete the feature branch (optional but recommended)

---

## ⚔️ 7. Handling Merge Conflicts (VS Code Guide)

When pulling or rebasing, you might get a merge conflict. VS Code will show:
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your local changes
=======
Incoming changes from main
>>>>>>> main
```

### Steps to resolve:
1. Manually choose or combine both changes.
2. After fixing:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "resolve: merge conflict in <file>"
   ```
3. Then push again:
   ```bash
   git push origin feat/<feature-name>
   ```

| ✅ Practice                     | 💡 Why It Matters                              |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Always branch from `main`     | Start with stable code                        |
| Use meaningful branch names   | Easy to understand purpose                    |
| Commit often, but meaningfully| Easier to debug and roll back                 |
| Sync with `main` regularly    | Avoid large conflicts later                   |
| Review PRs before merging     | Improve code quality and team learning        |
| Prefer rebase over merge (optional) | Keeps history linear and clean            |

git checkout branch-name

# Create a new branch
git checkout -b new-branch

# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "message"

# Push branch
git push origin branch-name

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Rebase from main
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# Resolve conflicts then continue
git rebase --continue
```

## 🔁 9. Important: Always Pull Main Before Creating Merge Request

Before you create a pull/merge request into `main`, make sure to **pull the latest main branch** and resolve any merge conflicts **locally**.

```bash
git checkout feat/<your-feature>
git pull origin main
# Resolve merge conflicts if any
git add .
git commit -m "merge: resolved conflicts with main before PR"
git push origin feat/<your-feature>
```

Only after this, create a Pull Request on GitHub to merge your branch into `main`.
